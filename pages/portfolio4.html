            <p>
              <b><i>Hardware</i></b> of a computer is made up of complex
              electronic circuits. For a user, the details of the circuitry are
              not important. However, the hardware units with which a user has
              to interact must be clearly understood. For convenience, the
              hardware of a computer can be classified in the following
              categories:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Input Devices:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Data is not always in a computer-friendly format, so input
                    devices are needed to convert it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    These devices take user data and instructions, transform
                    them into a form the computer can process, and send it to
                    the system.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    For example, to enter employees' names, you'd use an input
                    device—not paper.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Output Devices:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A computer's processed output isn't always user-readable, so
                    output devices convert it into a form users can understand.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The CPU is the computer's "brain," essential for its
                    function.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It consists of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which
                    handles calculations, and the Control Unit (CU), which
                    manages other hardware.
                  </li>
                  <li>CPUs excel in both speed and control.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Memory or Storage:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    This hardware stores all data and instructions for a
                    computer, including processing results.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Computers have different memory types, with some directly
                    linked to the CPU, offering very fast data access. These are
                    called primary memory—such as RAM (Random Access Memory) and
                    ROM (Read Only Memory).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The CPU uses data and instructions only from primary memory.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Primary memories come in types: volatile memory, like RAM,
                    loses its contents when power is off, while non-volatile
                    memory, like ROM, retains data without power.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Secondary storage devices, such as hard disks, floppy disks,
                    and CD-ROMs, are external and portable.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Devices like input, output, and secondary storage are not
                    directly linked to the CPU, so they are called peripheral
                    devices.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Motherboard:</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The motherboard, also known as the system board, is the main
                    hardware component of a microcomputer.

                  <li>
                    It connects all other circuit boards with chips and
                    electronic parts, acting as the central "mother" to all
                    components.

              The <b><i>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</i></b> is the computer's
              core processor, executing instructions and processing data. In
              microcomputers, the CPU, known as a microprocessor, is a
              single-chip component. Together with memory, it forms the central
              system that connects to all peripherals.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The CPU consists of the following distinct parts:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The CPU's arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) handles all
                    arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
                    multiplication, division) and logical comparisons (less
                    than, equal to, greater than).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

                <strong>Control Unit</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The control unit manages data and instruction flow between
                    computer units, coordinating all operations like a "Central
                    Nervous System."
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It retrieves, interprets, and directs instructions and
                    handles data transfer between memory and peripherals.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Registers are fast memory circuits that temporarily store
                    data, instructions, or addresses for the ALU during
                    operations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each holds one word (2 bytes, or 16 bits) until replaced.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Their type and number vary by CPU, with categories including
                    General Purpose, Pointer, Segment, Index, Flags, and
                    Instruction Pointer Registers.
                  </li>

                <strong>Buses</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Data is stored in registers as eight-bit units, where each
                    bit (0 or 1) is transferred via individual wires.

                  <li>
                    A group of eight wires used to transfer data between

                  <li>
                    A bus connects components to transmit signals and comes in

            <p>
              <b><i>Input devices</i></b> are used to enter data, information,
              and instructions into RAM. They typically function as standalone
              data entry units with a small processor, keyboard, and display.
              The processor ensures data accuracy during input.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The common input devices are the following:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Keyboard:</strong> The keyboard is a common computer
                input device with a QWERTY layout similar to a typewriter. It
                typically has three sections: typing keys, cursor movement keys,
                and a numeric keypad. The Num Lock key activates the numeric
                keypad for quick number entry. Standard keyboards are flat and
                include special function keys, arrow keys, and cursor controls.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Mouse:</strong> When using a display, we often point to
                select options and navigate on the screen. A mouse allows smooth
                cursor movement; an optical mouse is quiet and reliable, while a
                mechanical one is more affordable. In Windows, users perform
                “point-and-click” actions by aiming the pointer, moving the
                mouse, and clicking or double-clicking as needed. Laptops may
                use touchpads, trackballs, or other pointer devices with extra
                click keys. Wrist pads can help reduce strain during extended
                use.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Trackball:</strong> A trackball resembles a mouse but
                has a roller on top and buttons on the side. It moves the cursor
                by spinning the ball in the desired direction. Often preferred
                for requiring minimal arm movement and space, it is commonly
                used with portable computers.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Light Pen:</strong> A light pen is a pen-shaped pointing
                device for selecting items or drawing on a screen. It has a
                light receptor that activates when pressed against the display,
                detecting its position. A photocell and optical system in the
                pen send signals to the CPU, enabling responsive actions on the
                screen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Touch Screen:</strong> A touch screen responds to finger
                taps, allowing users to select items directly on the screen
                without pressing keys.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Game Controller:</strong> A game controller is used with
                gaming systems to control characters or provide input. It
                connects to consoles or computers via wired or wireless methods
                and includes devices like keyboards, mice, gamepads, and
                joysticks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Microphone:</strong> A microphone, or mic, is a hardware
                device that lets users input audio into their computers.

            <br />
            <p>
              Once data is processed, output devices translate the language of
              bits into a form humans can understand.
              <b><i>Output devices</i></b> are divided into two basic
              categories: those that produce hard copy, including printers and
              plotters; and those that produce soft (digital) copy, including
              monitors (the most commonly used output devices. The output
              normally can be produced in two ways - either on a display
              unit/device or on a paper. Other kinds of output, such as speech
              output, are also being used in certain applications.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Monitors:</strong> A Visual Display Unit (VDU), or
                monitor, is a computer's primary output device. It uses a
                Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) to show characters and forms images from
                small dots, called pixels. Image clarity, or resolution, depends
                on pixel quantity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Video Controller:</strong> A video adapter, also called
                a graphics card or video controller, is an internal circuit
                board that enables a display device like a monitor to show
                images from the computer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>PC Projector:</strong> A projector uses light and lenses
                to enlarge and display images on a larger screen or wall,
                whether still or moving, depending on its design.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Speakers:</strong> A hardware device linked to a

            <br />
            <p>
              <b><i>Programming languages</i></b> are classified as lower or
              higher based on how close they are to the computer's language
              (machine language, which uses 0s and 1s) or to human languages
              (higher, which is more English-like).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The main categories of programming languages are:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Machine Language:</strong> Programs written only in
                binary digits are called machine language programs. Writing and
                understanding machine language is challenging.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    In binary, letters and special characters are represented by
                    sequences of 0s and 1s; for example, the letter A is
                    represented as 1000001.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Special characters like commas and semicolons are also
                    represented in binary.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assembly Language:</strong> In the 1950s, assembly
                languages were created to simplify programming by using mnemonic
                codes instead of binary.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    These languages are converted to machine code to be
                    executed.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Assembly language programs are called source programs, while
                    machine code programs are object programs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each assembly instruction directly corresponds to a machine
                    code instruction, but macro instructions were introduced to
                    group multiple instructions for efficiency.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>High-Level Language:</strong> High-level languages
                simplified programming by reducing the need for detailed
                computer operations, allowing programmers to focus more on the
                problem-solving logic.

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Procedural Programming Language:</strong> Focuses on
                executing a sequence of statements to achieve a result, using
                variables, loops, and other elements. Functions may control
                variables and perform tasks like printing.
                <ul>
                  <li>C</li>
                  <li>Pascal</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Functional Programming Language:</strong> Emphasizes
                functions' return values and discourages side effects and state
                changes. Avoids loops in favor of recursion.
                <ul>
                  <li>Python</li>
                  <li>Haskell</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Object-Oriented Programming Language:</strong> Treats
                the world as objects with internal data and methods to access
                it. Focuses on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for
                reusability.
                <ul>
                  <li>Java</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scripting Programming Language:</strong> Often
                procedural and may include object-oriented features, but
                typically not used for large system development.
                <ul>
                  <li>JavaScript</li>
                  <li>PHP</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Logic Programming Language:</strong> Allows declarative
                statements where the machine deduces consequences based on given
                rules, instead of specifying exact steps.
                <ul>
                  <li>Mercury</li>

              has helped me build a strong understanding of their components and
              functions. My curiosity, sparked at a young age, led me to explore
              basic hardware and software concepts. Through this portfolio, I
              have gained a deeper appreciation for the evolution of computing,
              from personal computers to modern supercomputers. I have learned
              that hardware, such as the CPU and storage systems, represents the
              physical components, while software provides the instructions that
              make these elements work together.

              Moreover, it also provided insight into how different types of
              computers—ranging from mainframes to personal devices—serve unique
              purposes based on their power. I found it fascinating to see how
              computational power influences fields like finance, education, and
              entertainment. A key highlight was my deep dive into the CPU,
              particularly the ALU and Control Unit. I now have a better
              understanding of how the processor manages data and interacts with
              memory and peripheral devices. Learning how the CPU handles tasks
              like arithmetic operations and decision-making has deepened my
              appreciation for the complexity of even the most basic
              computational tasks.

            <p>
              Exploring software also helped me understand how system software,
              such as operating systems, bridges the user and hardware,
              optimizing performance for efficient application execution. The
              distinction between system and application software became clearer
              as I explored how they collaborate to provide a seamless user
              experience. Additionally, delving into networking and
              communication protocols broadened my view of how devices connect
              and share information across networks, though this aspect is not
              included in the portfolio. I was captivated by how computers
              impact sectors like business, healthcare, and entertainment,
              showcasing their versatility and importance.

              Overall, this portfolio deepened my understanding of computer
              systems and inspired me to stay updated with technological
              advancements, fueling my commitment to continuous learning and
              innovation. It has reinforced my passion for computer science and
              motivated me to continue exploring new avenues for growth.
