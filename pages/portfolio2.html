                    An information system (IS) is a network of components that

              First of all, I had a hard time searching for multiple sources of
              information on the assigned topics. However, I was glad that most
              of the sources I gathered helped deepen my understanding of
              Information Systems. Many people, especially those unfamiliar with
              the difference between data and information, may think both terms
              refer to the same thing. It is essential to learn the distinction
              between the two as we encounter them in our daily lives. For
              example, when we use transportation apps such as Angkas, upon
              installing the app, we are most likely asked for our name,
              address, contact number, etc., which are then transformed into
              information. This information helps the drivers reach us quickly.
              This is why knowing how to distinguish between data and
              information makes these processes easier.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              Information Systems is not entirely new to me, as I read about it
              once when I was preparing to compete in a quiz bowl. However, my
              knowledge of Information Systems was neither deep nor shallow at
              the time. I had some knowledge about the different types of
              support systems within Information Systems, and creating this
              portfolio helped me understand the roles, similarities, and
              differences between them. One key system I encountered is the
              Transaction Processing System (TPS). This is fundamental to any
              business because it handles routine transactions like billing,
              payroll, and order processing. From my experience, TPS has allowed
              for the automation of repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources
              for more complex activities.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              In conclusion, despite the initial challenge of finding multiple
              sources on the assigned topics, the research process significantly
              deepened my understanding of Information Systems. Learning to
              differentiate between data and information proved essential, as it
              enhances the efficiency of everyday applications such as
              transportation apps. My prior knowledge of Information Systems was
              expanded further through this portfolio, particularly in
              understanding the various support systems. Overall, I have
              broadened my comprehension and appreciation of Information Systems
              and their impact on both businesses and daily life.
