                    Originated in the early 1940s from algorithm theory,
                    mathematical logic, and the invention of the stored-program
                    electronic computer (Denning, 1999).

            <br />
            <p>
              As a child, I was always curious about how computers work, which
              is one reason I chose computer science as my course. I want to
              learn more about computers, and I have no regrets about choosing
              this path, as I believe technology is our future. With technology
              evolving every day, having little to no knowledge about it makes
              you feel irrelevant. While researching online, I gained a deeper
              understanding of the vastness of the computing world. Initially, I
              had a basic idea of how computer science differed from computer
              engineering, but I didn't fully grasp their distinct focuses and
              roles. Additionally, though I was somewhat familiar with other
              fields and disciplines of computing, I now have a clearer
              understanding of their differences.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              People often say that computer science is just about programming,
              and I used to think the same. However, as Peter Denning has noted,
              computer science encompasses far more than programming, such as
              designing operating system layers, structuring databases, and
              validating models. While programming was one of the reasons I
              chose this course, I've realized that there is much more to learn
              beyond it. Computer science is part of a larger picture. This
              broader perspective has not only deepened my understanding but
              also enlightened me that computer science is more than just
              programming.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              Delving deeper into computer science made me realize there's much
              more to learn beyond programming, and it's a step-by-step process.
              As technology evolves daily, I understand the importance of
              continuous learning to stay relevant. Furthermore, learning more
              about computer science has increased my interest in the field. As
              for now, I have not decided yet on what to specialize in but
              exploring topics like data science, artificial intelligence, and
              cybersecurity has opened my mind for growth and discovery. Each
              new concept and technology fuels my curiosity and drives me to
              further discover and contribute to the ever-expanding field of
              computer science.
