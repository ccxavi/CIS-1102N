                    designed for high-speed performance, often the fastest
                    available at a given time. It is primarily used for
                    scientific and engineering tasks requiring high-speed
                    calculations, such as modeling complex physical phenomena,

                    management. Its use declined in the 1980s with the rise of

                    A server is a computer or system designed to share
                    information with other devices. Servers vary in type and
                    size, offering diverse services to different networks. They
                    can take the form of computers, software, or storage
                    devices, but their primary role is consistent: to receive,
                    store, and share data. Like an electronic filing cabinet,
                    servers organize data, but they are far more versatile,
                    enabling data sharing across households or even nationwide
                    networks in real time.
